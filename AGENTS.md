# Agent Instructions

- Review `REQUIREMENTS.md` before making changes to understand the functional and non-functional expectations.
- Implement no more than one task from `TODO.md` at a time. After completing a task, mark it as done by replacing `[ ]` with `[x]` in `TODO.md`.
- Only perform the work described in the `MAIN_TASK` tag.
- When creating new tasks in Ask CODEX mode, use the `MAIN_TASK` tag to denote the task text, and include only a single item to complete.
- Execute a TODO item only if the `MAIN_TASK` explicitly states that the next step of the plan should be carried out.
